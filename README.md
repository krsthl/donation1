Homes for the elderly are facilities that provide shelter and care for the elderly who have been abandoned, orphaned, or taken from their families due to abuse or neglect. These elderly people frequently lack basic necessities, including food, clothes, housing, and healthcare. As a result, people rely on charitable funds to satisfy their needs and improve their quality of life.
The Sta Ana - San Joaquin Bahay Ampunan Foundation Inc. is an orphanage for elderly individuals who have lost contact with their family. This shelter is located at Brgy. Altura, Tanauan, Batangas. Because of the foundation's distant location and lack of public awareness, it is difficult for the specified orphanage for the elderly to raise finances for the foundation.
To address these concerns, a more effective and efficient orphanage donation system that promotes openness, accountability, and sustainability is required. This mobile application would not only assist Sta Ana- San Joaquin Bahay Ampunan Foundation Inc., but it would also allow people to have a significant and beneficial effect on the said foundation. Instead of going to the orphanage to donate funds, donors can donate money using the mobile application. This can avoid the hassle and make their donation in a more convenient, time saving, and secure manner.
